Perf_Cal_StimOn.m	Calculates behavioral performance metrics during stimulation-on periods with Force sensor. Compares stim-on vs baseline conditions.
com_freq_v2_Proper.m	Performs frequency-domain analysis of EEG/EMG signals.
eeg_task_stim.m	Processes EEG data aligned with task events during stimulation.
multicom_freq.m	Conducts multi-frequency analysis for complex signal comparisons.
timefreq_task.m	Applies time-frequency decomposition (e.g., wavelet/FFT) to task-related EEG data.
